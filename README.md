This directory contains the code and data used for the project "The Cosmic Web Through Network Analysis", in which the web-like structure in which the Universe organizes itself is studied through the machinery of Network analysis. The resulting report can be found in. The code is available in the "main.py" file. The Data folder contains the text files:
